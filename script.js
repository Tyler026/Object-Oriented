class stadium1 {
    constructor ()
} new Stadium("Mercedes Benz Arena", "Atlanta", 70000);

stadium1.describeStadium();

// Leverage your knowledge of the JavaScript programming language to create a Stadium class. The constructor function for this class should have the following properties: a name, city, and capacity. Add a method called describeStadium() that logs out a formatted description of the stadium to the console.

// Create Stadium class.
// Add the constructor function.
// The constructor should contain three properties:
// name - Name of the stadium
// city - What city is the stadium located in?
// capacity - How many fans can fit in the stadium?
// Add describeStadium() method
